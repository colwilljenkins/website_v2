    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p> I'm currently nearing the end of my MSc in Computer Science with Data Analytics with the University of York,
        I just have my thesis left! I've been living in Paris, France since 2020 and have been completing my degree
        online. Since November 2022, I have been freelancing some data analytics for a telecoms company. I'm looking
        forward to completing my degree and finding a full time role to launch my career here in Paris.
